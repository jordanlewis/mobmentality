Final project for CMSC 23800 Game Construction: Group AI behaviors

To run, make &&make make test. You need mostly the same dependencies as for
z-fight-club's group project, minus OpenAL.

The relevant code is mostly in ai.*, aimanager.*, and controllers.*. A good
amount of code is reused from the group project, but I had to retool a bunch
of things to get everything uniform.


The world the agents move on is a torus.

Press n while running to cycle between AI behaviors.
